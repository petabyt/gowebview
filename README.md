# Go Android WebView
Write Android apps in HTML/CSS/JS with a Golang backend.

## To start:
1. Cd into `template` or make a copy of it.
2. `./init.sh` (you may have to `sudo chmod +x init.sh`)
3. run `build.sh` (Edit it to change it to your package)

## Requirements
1. Gomobile
2. Android SDK

## Releasing
I'm not so sure about building for release yet, but making  
an release key would be needed.
